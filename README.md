# TestCafe Reporter Slack for face-ui-test

### testcafe-reporter-slack

This is a reporter for [TestCafe](http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe). It sends the output of test(s) to [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## Purpose :dart:

Once configured the reporter sends test results to Slack channel, e.g.

**SUMMARY logging level output reports**

![Slack report - success](assets/slack-report-success.png)

![Slack report - failed](assets/slack-report-failed.png)

## Installation :construction:

Install this reporter as your test project dependency (already done in `face-ui-test`):

```bash
npm i testcafe-reporter-slack --save
```

## Modifying the reporter:

Any changes made in the `src` directory need to be processed and outputted to `lib` using `npm run build`â€”which will use the methods defined in `Gulpfile.js` for the build.

It's recommened you `npm link` this repo to the `face-ui-test` repo when developing locally. Remember to `npm run build` everytime you make changes to the reporter.

## Setup instructions :wrench:

In order to use this TestCafe reporter plugin, it is necessary to add it as your reporter to your TestCafe.

### Using `.testcaferc.json` config file

Add a reporter name (`slack`) to your `reporter` object:

```json
{
  "browsers": ["chrome"],
  "reporter": [
    {
      "name": "slack"
    },
    {
      "name": "spec"
    }
  ]
}
```

### If using TestCafe API

Pass the reporter name (`slack`) to the `reporter()` method:

```js
testCafe
  .createRunner()
  .src("path/to/test/file.js")
  .browsers("chrome")
  .reporter("slack") // <-
  .run();
```

### Necessary configuration

After that, you should define a **.env** file with variables for your Slack reporting. This should placed in folder from where you call TestCafe from (the root directory).

```dotenv
# .env
TESTCAFE_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/*****
TESTCAFE_SLACK_CHANNEL=#channel-name
```

This is the **required minimum to have it working**.

## Options :gear:

This Slack reporter has a few options which could be configured from both, `.testcaferc.json` or `.env` file as global variables.
**It will first retrieve the values from the TestCafe config file `.testcaferc.json`**, after that from `.env` file.

- :warning: - **required**
- :balloon: - optional
- :link: - deprecated

#### Slack Webhook URL :warning:

**This option is required!** Your Slack channel webhook URL generated from Slack API to allow reporter post there.
It's **not recommended** to pass your `webhookUrl` into the config file, in this case, due to sensitive data, it's **better to pass it via global variable** in `.env` file.

- via `.testcaferc.json`

```json
{
  "name": "slack",
  "options": {
    "webhookUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/*****"
  }
}
```

- via `.env` file

```dotenv
# .env
TESTCAFE_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/*****
```

#### Username :balloon: :link:

Your Slack app username.

- via `.testcaferc.json`

```json
{
  "name": "slack",
  "options": {
    "username": "testcafebot"
  }
}
```

- via `.env` file

```dotenv
# .env
TESTCAFE_SLACK_USERNAME=testcafebot
```

#### Logging level

Choose your report logging level: 
- `SUMMARY` Show only number of tests which passed, failed and was skipped
- `TEST` Show report of tests that passed and failed
- `DEBUG` Show each test with error stack trace for failed tests

- via `.testcaferc.json`

```json
{
  "name": "slack",
  "options": {
    "loggingLevel": "SUMMARY"
  }
}
```

- via `.env` file

```dotenv
# .env
TESTCAFE_SLACK_LOGGING_LEVEL=SUMMARY
```

#### Quiet mode

Choose if you want to have messages in the terminal about sending specific messages to Slack, it's turned off by default.

- via `.testcaferc.json`

```json
{
  "name": "slack",
  "options": {
    "quietMode": true
  }
}
```

- via `.env` file

```dotenv
# .env
TESTCAFE_SLACK_QUIET_MODE=true
```

## Versioning & Releasing

> TL;DR: Commits prefixed with `fix: ` and `feat: ` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `master`. Read on for more details...
Don't forget the ` ` after `:`

The [sematic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/master/semantic-release) is called from the `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow to handle version changes and releasing.

### Version Changes

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules:
1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The next version number will be determined from the commit messages since the previous release. Our semantic-release configuration uses the [Angular convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) when analyzing commits:
* Commits which are prefixed with `fix:` or `perf:` will trigger a `patch` release. Example: `fix: validate input before using`
* Commits which are prefixed with `feat:` will trigger a `minor` release. Example: `feat: add toggle() method`
* To trigger a MAJOR release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines in the footer of the commit message
* Other suggested prefixes which will **NOT** trigger a release: `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:` and `test:`. Example: `docs: adding README for new component`

To revert a change, add the `revert:` prefix to the original commit message. This will cause the reverted change to be omitted from the release notes. Example: `revert: fix: validate input before using`.

### Releases

When a release is triggered, it will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Tag the commit
* Create a GitHub release (including release notes)
